# FlightCalculator
The following project was made for my algorithms and object-oriented programming class I.

This basic program was made to register flight information, suggest packages based on weight requirements, and show some additional information at the end of the program.

- src/ui holds the FlightCalculator.java

- docs holds all the documentation: Javadoc, analysis, and a flow diagram.

- bin/ui holds the binary files.
